  bio: `Czar is a healer who possesses a deep connection to nature and the natural world. She was born and raised in a small town in the American Southwest surrounded by indigenous tribes, and from them she learned about the healing properties of plants and water, as well as from her grandmother, who was a respected healer in the community.

  Growing up, Czar was always fascinated by the incredible diversity of plant life in the rainforest and the vital role that water played in sustaining it. She spent countless hours exploring the forest and studying the plants and animals that lived there, and she developed a deep respect and appreciation for the delicate balance of the ecosystem.Over time, she became increasingly concerned about the environmental destruction that was taking place in the rainforest. She witnessed firsthand the devastating effects of deforestation and pollution on the plants, animals, and people of the forest, and she knew that she had to take action to protect this precious ecosystem.
  
  Czar began studying botany and ecology in earnest, and she became a respected expert in water management and conservation, and she started working with local communities to develop sustainable agricultural practices that would help to preserve the rainforest.
  
  Through her work as a healer and ecological restoration expert, Czar has become a respected and beloved member of her community. She is known for her compassion, her deep knowledge of the natural world, and her tireless dedication to protecting the environment.
  
  Despite the many challenges she has faced, Czar remains optimistic about the future. She believes that by working together, we can create a world where people and nature can thrive together in harmony, and she is committed to doing everything in her power to make that vision a reality.`,
