  bio: `Vanessa is an artist and ceramicist who possesses a deep and abiding passion for the power of imagination. She grew up in a family of engineers and creatives, where she was encouraged to explore her own artistic instincts from an early age. As she grew older, Vanessa became increasingly interested in the intersection of art and technology, and she began to explore the potential of digital media and virtual reality as new mediums for creative expression.

  As she continued to develop her artistic practice, Vanessa became increasingly fascinated with the concept of uploading minds into a simulation engine. She saw this as a way to preserve the collective imagination of the people of Bombay Beach, capturing their hopes, dreams, and aspirations in a digital form that could be shared and experienced by future generations.
  
  Vanessa's passion for this idea led her to become deeply involved in the development of the Simulation Engine. She worked tirelessly to create virtual environments and experiences that would capture the essence of life in Bombay Beach, using her skills as a ceramicist to create stunning and immersive landscapes and installations.
  
  Through her work on the Simulation Engine, Vanessa has become a respected and influential figure in the worlds of art and technology. She is known for her visionary thinking, her boundless creativity, and her unwavering commitment to using her talents to make a positive impact on the world.
  
  Despite the controversy and skepticism that surrounds the concept of mind uploading, Vanessa remains steadfast in her belief that this technology has the potential to transform our understanding of what it means to be human. She sees it as a way to preserve the beauty and complexity of the human mind for generations to come, and she is determined to see this vision become a reality.`,
