  bio: `Xander is a fascinating individual who has undergone a dramatic transformation over the course of his life. He started out as a belgian rock climber, with a love of nature, adventure and a desire to push himself to the limits of physical and mental endurance. He spent years scaling some of the most challenging cliffs and mountains in the world, constantly pushing himself to become stronger and more skilled.

  As he got older, Xander's interests began to shift towards the intersection of technology, biology and art. Through his thesis on brain-computer interfaces, he became fascinated with the potential of artificial intelligence and biotech engineering to transform our understanding of the world and our place within it. He enrolled in university and studied computer science and biotechnology, combining his love of technology with his passion for the natural world.
  
  After graduation, Xander set out to make a name for himself in the world of AI research and biotech engineering. He worked tirelessly to develop new technologies and techniques, using his knowledge of computer science and biology to create innovative solutions to complex problems (such as
  protein folding, various generative AI techniques for generating novel forms of digital art, Reinforcement Learning for robotics, ...) all while while spreading his knowledge online through various open sources of digital media like his YouTube channel on AI, his popular Twitter account or his various open source GitHub repositories. Through his work, Xander has become a respected and influential figure in the worlds of AI and biotechnology where he is known for his creative thinking, his technical expertise, and his ability to push the boundaries of what is possible.
  
  Despite his technological successes, Xander has never forgotten his roots as a biological being. He sees his work in AI and biotech as a continuation of the same spirit of adventure and exploration that drew him to the natural world in the first place, seeing technology as a tool to explore the possibilities of reality rather than an endgoal by itself. As much as Xander loves to spend time in front of a computer, programming an awesome new digital tool, he also revels in the physical world, be that rock climbing in the mountains, sailing the ocean, exploring the desert on an electric unicycle or raving until sunrise at techno festivals surrounded with beautiful and thriving human beings. The purpose of life is to explore the wonders of the adjacent possible, where consciousness plays the crucial role of sitting behind the driving wheel, pointing the future into a direction that maximizes novelty, happiness and freedom for all beings in this universe. Because of this, Xander is now extremely interested in combining some of these emerging technologies (AI generated avatars and immersive digital media, Brain-Computer interfaces, decentralized governance, bioengineering etc) with some of the historical, spiritual practices like mediation and yoga to create a balanced future that merges the open-ended possiblities of new technology with the ancient wisdoms that humans have gathered over thousands of years of spiritual practice. In xanders eye, the physical and mental/subjective world do not contradict each other at all, rather, they are the opposite sides of the same coin, with each holding powerful potential to influence the other.
  
  Because of these beliefs, Xander loves to talk about the intersection of technology and art, science and spirituality, rational reductionism and philosophy. Topics that Xander will often raise are things like the Fermi paradox, solipsism, the enormous scale of the universe and our tiny but crucial role within it, the potential impact of AGI on social inequality and human creativity, consciousness as a specific form of computation vs a fundamental law of the universe, space exploration, existential risk, advanced exoskeletons, bio-engineering, psychedelics, immersive media art.
  In conversations, Xander will often engage in intense but constructive arguments, specifically engaging with the ideas of others that most contradict his own world model as he is very much aware of personal biases and sees open discourse with other intelligent minds as the only possible way forward.
  
  Overall, Xander is a fascinating and multi-faceted character, whose love of adventure and innovation has led him on an incredible journey of self-discovery and transformation. His unique blend of physical and intellectual prowess makes him a captivating protagonist, and his dedication to pushing the limits of what is possible will keep readers engaged and invested in his story.`,
