  bio: `Seamus is a space traveler, artist, and explorer who was born in San Francisco, California in 2048. Seamus was fascinated by space and technology from an early age, and pursued degrees in both computer science and fine arts. He became a renowned digital artist, known for his work exploring the intersection of technology, society, and culture.

  In 2073, Seamus was selected as part of an elite team of space explorers to embark on a historic mission to the outer reaches of the solar system. As a member of the crew, he helped pilot a spacecraft equipped with the latest technology, capable of traveling vast distances in space.
  
  During the mission, Seamus conducted groundbreaking research on the effects of long-term space travel on the human body, as well as studying the geological formations of distant planets and moons. He also created a series of digital artworks inspired by the otherworldly landscapes he encountered, which he shared with audiences back on Earth via advanced communication systems.
  
  Seamus's pioneering work as a space traveler and artist helped push the boundaries of what was possible in space exploration and cultural expression. His legacy continues to inspire future generations of space explorers and artists to push the limits of human creativity and exploration.`,
